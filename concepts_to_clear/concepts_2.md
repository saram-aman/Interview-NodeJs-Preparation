**1. Streams:**

* **Understanding Streams:**
    * Streams are a fundamental concept in Node.js for handling sequential data. They allow you to process data in chunks, without loading the entire dataset into memory.
    * Types: Readable, Writable, Duplex, Transform.
    * Piping: Efficiently connecting Readable streams to Writable streams.
* **Use Cases:**
    * File I/O, network communication, handling large datasets.
* **Interview Questions:**
    * "What are streams in Node.js, and why are they important?"
    * "Explain the different types of streams."
    * "How does piping work?"
    * "How would you handle a large file using streams?"
    * "When would you use a transform stream?"

**2. Event Emitter:**

* **Understanding the Event Emitter:**
    * The `EventEmitter` class is a core component of Node.js that enables objects to emit and listen for events.
    * It's used extensively in the Node.js core and in many third-party modules.
* **Use Cases:**
    * Handling asynchronous events, building custom event-driven systems.
* **Interview Questions:**
    * "What is the `EventEmitter` in Node.js?"
    * "How do you emit and listen for events?"
    * "Describe a scenario where you would use the `EventEmitter`."
    * "How do you handle errors in event emitters?"

**3. File System (fs) Module:**

* **Understanding the fs Module:**
    * The `fs` module provides APIs for interacting with the file system.
    * Synchronous vs. asynchronous methods.
* **Key Operations:**
    * Reading and writing files, creating and deleting directories, checking file existence.
* **Interview Questions:**
    * "How do you read and write files in Node.js?"
    * "What are the differences between synchronous and asynchronous file system operations?"
    * "How do you handle file system errors?"
    * "How do you efficiently read large files?"

**4. Networking (http, https, net) Modules:**

* **Understanding Networking:**
    * Node.js is well-suited for building network applications.
    * The `http`, `https`, and `net` modules provide APIs for creating HTTP servers, making HTTP requests, and working with TCP sockets.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * HTTP requests and responses, TCP sockets, server-side vs. client-side networking.
* **Interview Questions:**
    * "How do you create an HTTP server in Node.js?"
    * "How do you make HTTP requests using the `http` or `https` module?"
    * "What are TCP sockets, and how are they used in Node.js?"
    * "How do you handle different HTTP methods?"

**5. Express.js (or other frameworks):**

* **Understanding Frameworks:**
    * Express.js is a popular framework for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.
    * Understanding routing, middleware, and request/response handling.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Routing, middleware, RESTful APIs, templating engines.
* **Interview Questions:**
    * "What are the benefits of using Express.js?"
    * "Explain the concept of middleware."
    * "How do you define routes in Express.js?"
    * "How do you handle request parameters and query strings?"
    * "What are RESTful APIs?"

**6. Database Interaction:**

* **Understanding Database Interaction:**
    * Node.js is often used to build backend applications that interact with databases.
    * Understanding how to connect to databases (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL) and perform CRUD operations.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Database drivers, ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers), query building.
* **Interview Questions:**
    * "How do you connect to a database from Node.js?"
    * "What are ORMs, and why are they used?"
    * "How do you perform CRUD operations in Node.js?"
    * "How do you prevent SQL injection when working with databases?"

**7. Error Handling:**

* **Understanding Error Handling:**
    * Robust error handling is crucial for building reliable Node.js applications.
    * Understanding how to handle synchronous and asynchronous errors.
* **Key Concepts:**
    * `try...catch` blocks, error-first callbacks, promises, `async/await`, unhandled promise rejections, uncaught exceptions.
* **Interview Questions:**
    * "How do you handle errors in asynchronous Node.js code?"
    * "What are error-first callbacks?"
    * "How do you handle unhandled promise rejections and uncaught exceptions?"
    * "What are best practices for error logging?"

**8. Testing:**

* **Understanding Testing:**
    * Writing unit tests and integration tests is essential for ensuring code quality.
    * Understanding testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
* **Key Concepts:**
    * Unit testing, integration testing, test-driven development (TDD).
* **Interview Questions:**
    * "What testing frameworks have you used?"
    * "How do you write unit tests and integration tests in Node.js?"
    * "What are the benefits of testing?"
    * "How do you mock dependencies in your tests?"
