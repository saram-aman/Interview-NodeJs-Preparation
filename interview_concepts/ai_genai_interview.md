## 2. LangChain

### Overview
LangChain is a framework for building applications with LLMs, enabling chaining of prompts, tool use, memory, and agentic workflows.

- **Chains:** Sequences of LLM calls and logic (e.g., prompt → LLM → tool → LLM).
- **Agents:** LLMs that decide which tools/actions to use dynamically based on context.
- **Tools:** External APIs, functions, or code that agents can invoke.
- **Memory:** Mechanisms for storing and retrieving conversation or workflow state.
- **Integration:** Works with OpenAI, HuggingFace, vector DBs, and custom tools.

### Advanced Topics
- **Custom Agents:** Building agents with custom toolsets, prompt templates, and reasoning strategies.
- **Multi-step Reasoning:** Decomposing complex tasks into sub-steps, using chains/agents recursively.

- **Tool Abstraction:** Wrapping APIs, code, or search as callable tools for agents.

### Sample Interview Questions
- **Q:** How do agents in LangChain differ from chains?
  - **A:** Agents use LLMs to select actions/tools at runtime, enabling dynamic workflows. Chains follow a fixed, pre-defined sequence.
- **Q:** How do you add custom memory to a LangChain agent?
  - **A:** Implement a memory class (e.g., VectorStoreMemory), integrate with the agent, and ensure state is updated and retrieved as needed.
- **Q:** What are the challenges of tool integration in agentic workflows?
  - **A:** Tool reliability, latency, error handling, and ensuring the LLM understands tool outputs and when to use them.

## 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipelines

### Overview
RAG pipelines combine information retrieval with LLM generation, grounding responses in external data for improved factuality and context.

### Key Concepts
- **Retrieval:** Use of search (BM25, dense vector search) to fetch relevant documents or passages.
- **Augmentation:** Retrieved context is injected into the LLM prompt.
- **Generation:** LLM generates answers using both prompt and retrieved context.
- **Chunking:** Splitting documents into manageable pieces for retrieval.
- **Evaluation:** Precision, recall, answer relevance, factual accuracy.

### Advanced Topics
- **Hybrid Retrieval:** Combining sparse (BM25) and dense (embeddings) retrieval for better recall.
- **Context Window Management:** Selecting, summarizing, or ranking retrieved chunks to fit LLM limits.
- **Feedback Loops:** Using user feedback or model self-evaluation to improve retrieval/generation.
- **Latency Optimization:** Caching, parallel retrieval, and prompt optimization for real-time use.

### Sample Interview Questions
- **Q:** What are the main steps in a RAG pipeline?
  - **A:** Retrieve relevant documents, select and format context, inject into LLM prompt, generate answer, optionally post-process.
- **Q:** How do you evaluate a RAG system?
  - **A:** Use retrieval metrics (recall, precision), answer quality (human eval, BLEU/ROUGE), and latency/throughput.
- **Q:** How do you handle context window limitations in RAG?
  - **A:** Rank or summarize retrieved chunks, use sliding windows, or select only the most relevant passages.

## 4. Vector Databases (FAISS, Pinecone)

### Overview
Vector databases store and search high-dimensional embeddings for semantic search, RAG, and recommendation systems.

### Key Concepts
- **Embeddings:** Numeric vector representations of text, images, or other data.
- **Similarity Search:** Finding nearest neighbors in vector space (cosine, dot product, Euclidean).
- **Index Types:** Flat, IVF, HNSW, PQ (FAISS); managed, serverless (Pinecone).
- **Scalability:** Sharding, replication, distributed search.
